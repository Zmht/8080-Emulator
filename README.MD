# 8080-Emulator

This is my program to emulate a Intel 8080 CPU. The Intel 8080 was created in the 1970s and sported 8-bit data sizes and up to 64 Kilobytes of memory. My emulator has a shell that you can use to provide the instruction that you want the cpu to run and then shows you the update state of the cpu. It is written in the C programming language and contains over 2000 lines of code.

## Features:
- Disassembler: You can generate a disassembled version of a compiled binary
- Emulator: Emulate single instructions in a simple shell like enviornment

## Run & Build:
### Linux/Mac:
- Ensure you have a C compiler (I reccomend clang) and then run the ```make``` command to compile.
- Run with ```./bin/zemulator```
## Windows:
- Not sure yet
